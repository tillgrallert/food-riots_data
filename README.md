This repository contains data and visualisations such as plots and maps for my research project on the [genealogy of food riots](https://tillgrallert.github.io/pages/research/category_food-riots/).

The folder hierarchy is as follows

- `catalogues/`: event catalogues
- `csv/`: mostly compiled and normalised price information.
- `maps/`: mostly GeoJSON files of important sites in late Ottoman Middle Eastern cities, such as Hama, Homs, Aleppo, Damascus etc.
- `plots/`: mostly R plots of price data
- `timeplots/`
- `xml/`: compiled and normalised price information; mostly TEI XML fragments.
